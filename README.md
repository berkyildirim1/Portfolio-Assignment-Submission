## Method Class Assignment

**Project**: [Method Class Assignment](https://github.com/berkyildirim1/Method-Class-Assignment-Submission)  
**Developer**: [@berkyildirim1](https://github.com/berkyildirim1)

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![Console App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Console-Application-blue)

This simple C# console application demonstrates method usage and parameter passing. It contains a NumberProcessor class with a method that processes two integer numbers, showing both positional and named parameter passing.

### Features

- Demonstration of different methods of parameter passing
- Simple mathematical operations
- Display of results on the console
- Basic principles of class and method structure

## Operators Assignment

**Project**: [Operators Assignment](https://github.com/berkyildirim1/Operators-Assignment-Submission)  
**Developer**: [@berkyildirim1](https://github.com/berkyildirim1)

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![Console App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Console-Application-blue)

This C# console application demonstrates the concept of operator overloading in C#. The project includes an Employee class with overloaded equality operators (== and !=) that compare employees based on their ID.

### Features

- Operator overloading for customized equality comparison
- Proper implementation of Object.Equals and GetHashCode methods
- Demonstration of the difference between reference and value equality
- Comparison examples for employees with different IDs and the same ID

## Polymorphism Assignment

**Project**: [Polymorphism Assignment](https://github.com/berkyildirim1/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission)  
**Developer**: [@berkyildirim1](https://github.com/berkyildirim1)

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![Console App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Console-Application-blue)
![OOP](https://img.shields.io/badge/OOP-Principles-orange)

This C# console application showcases polymorphism through interfaces. The project includes an Employee class that implements the IQuittable interface, demonstrating how interfaces enable polymorphic behavior.

### Features

- Interface implementation
- Demonstration of polymorphism principles
- Accessing the same method through different types
- Simulation of employee resignation process
- Implementation of Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles

## Entity Framework Code First

**Project**: [Entity Framework Code First](https://github.com/berkyildirim1/ASP.NET-MVC-Entity-Framework)  
**Developer**: [@berkyildirim1](https://github.com/berkyildirim1)

![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![Entity Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Entity-Framework-purple)
![SQL Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Server-red)

This C# console application demonstrates the Code First approach with Entity Framework. The project creates a school database with Student, Grade, and Course models, showing relationships between entities.

### Features

- Model definition using the Code First approach
- Establishing entity relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Usage of Data Annotations
- DbContext configuration
- Database CRUD operations
- Microsoft SQL Server LocalDB integration

## ASP.NET MVC Car Insurance

**Project**: [ASP.NET MVC Car Insurance](https://github.com/berkyildirim1/ASP.NET-MVC-Entity-Framework-Assignment)  
**Developer**: [@berkyildirim1](https://github.com/berkyildirim1)
